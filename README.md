# Try Web Workers [![license](https://badgen.now.sh/badge/license/MIT)](./LICENSE)

Experiment to learn about all types of [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) available in Oct 2023.

## Stack

- Framework: [React](https://react.dev/)
- Styling: Pure CSS styles
  - Simply import your `.css` files into modules that use them.
  - Use the `classnames` package (`import classnames from 'classnames'`) to combine classes.
- Test runner: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- Testing framework: [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
  - All the tools come through the "global" `import { ... } from 'testingUtility'` module which
    can be imported from anywhere (path is aliased in Jest config).
  - Includes [jest-dom](https://testing-library.com/docs/ecosystem-jest-dom) extensions.
- Lint: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
  - Configured for the browser in `/src`, for Jest in `/src/**/__tests__` directories, and for
    node everywhere else.
  - Using the latest (currently `es2024`) syntax.
- Formatting: [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- Bundling: [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

## Running

Using the latest stable version of Node (v20) and NPM (v9.6)...

```bash
$ npm install
# installs all dependencies
$ npm start
# opens a browser to localhost:3000
# set ST_PORT=XXXX env to run on a different port

$ npm fmt
# formats the code using Prettier
$ npm build
# builds the production bundle
$ npm build:dev
# builds the development bundle
```

> ðŸ’¬ If your browser doesn't open, please open it manually to `localhost:3000`

## Testing

```bash
$ npm test
# checks formatting, linting, build, and tests
$ npm run test:unit
# runs unit tests only
$ npm run lint
# runs ESLint
$ npm run fmt:check
# runs Prettier in verification mode only
```

## Styles

Pure CSS, just `import './MyComponent.styles.css'` in your component's module
the styles will get loaded whenever/if ever the module is loaded at runtime.

See `./src/components/App/App.js` for an example.
